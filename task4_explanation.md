# Task 4 – Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange

Diffie-Hellman is a cryptographic method that allows two parties to generate the same secret key over an insecure channel.

It’s used in real-world systems like TLS (for HTTPS websites) and the Signal Protocol (for secure messaging).

The shared key never gets sent — only public values are exchanged, making it safe from eavesdropping.
